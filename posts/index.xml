      <title>I am implementing ndarray in pascal</title>

      <description>I love pascal. But I also love numpy&#39;s ndarray. Most of my project coded in python will most likely use numpy. There is no good solution (at least to me) for realizing ndarray functionality in pascal. Thus, I am trying to implement one on my own (here). So be it.
Meet noe I am not trying to be pretentious by competing with numpy. Heck, nobody is trying to compete with numpy.</description>

      <description>I know that blogging takes time. I know that it is not easy to stay committed to writing. Nonetheless, I feel something missing if I have no personal development blog, as I am involved in many projects, as well as my personal projects. Furthermore, writing what I&#39;ve learned tends to make me understand them better.
Scope of my blog I want to stay focused and relevant. Software development and machine learning are my strong suit (I mean, relatively stronger than any others of mine).</description>
