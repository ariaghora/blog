    <h1 class="article title">Hello fellow mortals. I started a blog.</h1><p class="article date">Friday, January 10, 2020</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>I know that blogging takes time. I know that it is not easy to stay committed to writing. Nonetheless, I feel something missing if I have no personal development blog, as I am involved in many projects, as well as my personal projects. Furthermore, writing what I've learned tends to make me understand them better.</p>
<h2 id="scope-of-my-blog">Scope of my blog</h2>
<p>I want to stay focused and relevant. Software development and machine learning are my strong suit (I mean, relatively stronger than any others of mine). Thus, mostly I will talk about them, even though it is also possible to extend the scope, such as my personal opinion about more general topics.</p>
<h2 id="language">Language</h2>
<p>Mostly I will write in English, since the topics in the scope of my blog are discussed in English. Sometimes I will probably write in Bahasa Indonesia (my native language) if needed.</p>
