      <description>I know that blogging takes time. I know that it is not easy to stay committed to writing. Nonetheless, I feel something missing if I have no personal development blog, as I am involved in many projects, as well as my personal projects. Furthermore, writing what I&#39;ve learned tends to make me understand them better.
Scope of my blog I want to stay focused and relevant. Software development and machine learning are my strong suit (I mean, relatively stronger than any others of mine).</description>
